Description:
===============

In this problem we are passing a number (n) into a function.

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

The function needs to return either a true or false.

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

Floats are considered UNeven for this problem.

How To Solve:
===============
This repository contains two files:
1. Number.java - This includes the code for the Number class, and is the file that you will modify.
1. NumberTest.java - This is the JUnit Test class for the problem. It contains tests that will tell you if your problem is working or not.

Workflow:
------------
* Right click on NumberTest.java and select Run As... JUnit Test
* Review the issues raised, and correct the code as needed.
* Continue running the Tests until all tests pass.
* Once all tests are passing, commit and push your changes to the repository.
